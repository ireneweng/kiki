Kiki's Delivery Service Random Maze Generator Game // Fall 2014 112 Term Project

My 15-112 project is a maze puzzle game, in which the player has a limited field of vision and must navigate through a randomly generated maze. The player must collect packages within the maze while avoiding people, and once all the packages are collected, the player must deliver them to the monster, which serves as the exit to the next level. The player is rewarded with points and an increased level of visibility for each package collected. Similarly, points are deducted for colliding with each obstacle, and either visibility decreases or a life is lost. The player is also against the clock, and running out of time will result in the loss of a life.

In the custom level mode, the player can design their own maze and play on it, with randomly generated placement of all the packages and obstacles.

The game is run in Python using Tkinter, with no external libraries or modules.
